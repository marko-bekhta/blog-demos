= Bean Validation: Validation based on multiple properties

This demo project shows how http://beanvalidation.org/[Bean Validation] can be used to implement
validation rules that require knowledge of the state of multiple properties of the same bean.
Next approaches are considered:

- Usage of getter and `@AssertTrue`
- Usage of `@ScriptAssert` as a class level constraint
- Usage of custom class level constraint
